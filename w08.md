6 algorithms on CPU Scheduling and its explanation

2. [Is there any difference between CPU scheduling and process scheduling?](hhttps://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-difference-between-CPU-scheduling-and-process-scheduling)<br>
CPU scheduling and process scheduling looks like a same problem, but it is different indeed. This article covers the differences between CPU and proccess scheduling
